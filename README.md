# NBEngine

My own GUI (and related stuff needed for GUI programs) engine. I suck at coding. Do not judge.

## Current Implemented Libraries

These are subject to (hopefully) grow in size as more stuff gets added.

* NBWindow: Creates and manages 

## Dependencies and Foundations

While the engine is intended to be a close-to-ground-up project, there's no point in reinventing the spokes that
make up a wheel. This project utilizes and depends on (expected to change and grow):

* GLFW
* Glad
